# Tracing Tokyo's air sources to identify Kawasaki Disease's etiological triggers

This document intends to expand, provide context and reproducible analysis code on the study presented in a [poster](https://github.com/helical-itn/anca2022-posters/raw/main/posters/ESR6.%20Alejandro%20Fontal/alejandro_poster_vasculitis_2022.pdf) for the [20th International Vasculitis and ANCA Workshop](https://vasculitis2022.org/), which takes place in Dublin, Ireland, from the 3rd to the 6th of April 2022.



## Background

**Kawasaki Disease (KD)** is a systemic vasculitis that mainly affects children **younger than 5 years old**. Although KD cases have been registered in over 60 countries across several continents, its incidence is **highest in East Easia**, particularly in **Japan**. After more than five decades since its discovery and active research, the etiology of KD is **yet to be elucidated**. Recent studies have analyzed the association between KD and diverse environmental factors, with some advances pointing towards a **relevant role of the atmospheric transport of a wind-borne agent triggering the disease** {cite}`rodo_association_2011, rodo_tropospheric_2014`. The specific nature of this agent(s) is still unknown, with biological (bacterial/fungal/viral) and chemical (pollution) elements being the strongest candidates to initiate the autoimmune cascade which leads to the disease.
