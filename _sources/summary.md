# Tracing Tokyo's air sources to identify Kawasaki Disease's etiological triggers

This document intends to expand, provide context and reproducible analysis code on the study presented in a [poster](https://github.com/helical-itn/anca2022-posters/raw/main/posters/ESR6.%20Alejandro%20Fontal/alejandro_poster_vasculitis_2022.pdf) for the [20th International Vasculitis and ANCA Workshop](https://vasculitis2022.org/), which takes place in Dublin, Ireland, from the 3rd to the 6th of April 2022.


## Background

**Kawasaki Disease (KD)** is a systemic vasculitis that mainly affects children **younger than 5 years old**. Although KD cases have been registered in over 60 countries across several continents, its incidence is **highest in East Easia**, particularly in **Japan**, where the highest annual incidence rate was recorded in 2018: **359 per 100 000 children aged 0-4 years** {cite}`AE202023`. After more than five decades since its discovery and active research, the etiology of KD is **yet to be elucidated**. Recent studies have analyzed the association between KD and diverse environmental factors, with some advances pointing towards a **relevant role of the atmospheric transport of a wind-borne agent triggering the disease** {cite}`rodo_association_2011, rodo_tropospheric_2014`. The specific nature of this agent(s) is still unknown, with biological (bacterial, fungal or viral) and chemical (pollution) elements being the strongest candidates to initiate the autoimmune cascade which leads to the disease.

One of the most striking features of the epidemiological dynamics of Kawasaki Disease is the defined **seasonal structure** across multiple countries, with broad coherence in fluctuations of cases across the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropical latitudes {cite}`burns_seasonality_2013`. 

In the case of Japan, the number of admissions have been recorded in the epidemiological records since 1970, and show the following pattern:

Three main features are notable:

+ The epidemic peaks of **1979**, **1982** and **1986** (and to a lesser degree, 1984).
+ The **increasing trend** starting around 1995 until today.
+ The marked **seasonality** from 2000 onwards.

All of this prompts several questions towards the nature of the drivers of these changes in incidence for a disease that is non-communicable in nature.

In this work, we focus on the period from **2010 to 2018** for the prefecture of **Tokyo**, and try to associate the **seasonal maxima** and **minima** to **atmospheric transport patterns**.
